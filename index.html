Midlife crisis? A cry for help?\u00a0\r\nWho could say? Only time can tell. In hindsight, salsa or pottery might have been a safer option.\u00a0Pinky Swears\u00a0marks Gill's first solo hour of comedy, which she debuted at\u00a0Edinburgh Fringe in 2023. She explores the twists and turns of the life of a woman who's always been known as being 'a bit out there' and never figured out how to 'fit in' and now she's a bit older, expected to pipe down.Getting older can make you fade away become invisible, but Gill isn't going to stand for it and asks you not to either.\u00a0In a world where superficiality reigns, Gill's ripping off the labels and getting down to the very funny core, telling stories of her wild life, bad choices and too much partying. We're all the same deep down, only the skin changes .Through the use of illustrations Gill shows her fine art degree wasn't a waste of time. She\u00a0weaves stories, jokes and observations that will make you feel so much better about your own choices .in amongst the tall tales Gill slips in a red herring and asks you to see if you can spot the lie?\u00a0But all the stories are so incredulous you will be hard pressed to tell the lie .If you love art stories and a good laugh bring your laughing gear .Jude Hines of Stage Whispers said: \"Female comedians are few and far between and award winning Gill Cordiner is a brilliant reminder that middle aged women have had years to build a repertoire of real life experiences on which to build hilarious routines. I am reminded of Rita Rudner, Sarah Millican and Phyllis Diller, and like them, this feisty Scotswoman mined her personal, family and sex life with laugh out loud anecdotes. Her routine about the Valentine\u2019s Day bondage gift had to be seen to be appreciated. Cordiner used witty, intelligent and self-deprecating humour, holding up a mirror to the reality of relationships. She is on my 2024 Fringe \u2018to see\u2019 list.\"\u00a0This show contains: Drug references, Occasional coarse language.",

Hosted by Josh Earl (Spicks and Specks) the podcast invites some of Josh\u2019s favourite people to share a bunch of hilarious stories all under the guise of a quizStarting in late 2014 this podcast has quickly garnered a loyal following as each week four people play a variety of games where all the answers are about each other. Because if Josh knows anything about comedians it\u2019s this, the one area of expertise they all share is themselves.From digging deep into each contestants\u2019 social media footprint in Social Me Me Media or embarrassing school stories in the round Year Book it is always hilarious and educational as guests look back on their pasts to stories they sometimes best want to forget.And of course Josh isn\u2019t safe either as each week he shares something in the round Knowing Me Knowing You where audiences find out just how good a bluffer he and his guests are as they try to guess if the story is about Josh or one of them.Previous guests include Hamish and Andy, Hannah Gadsby, Judith Lucy, James Acaster, Jason Byrne, Myf Warhurst, Sam Pang, Shaun Micallef, Wil Anderson, Celia Pacquola and pretty much anyone who is anyone in Australian comedy.One half Would I Lie To You, one half Facebook stalking, one half confessional, and another half terrible at math, it\u2019s always hilarious and educational.This show contains: Drug references, Occasional coarse language.",

Alex Hopes\u2019 wish they did. An unlikely duo forged in the fire of desperation, the blending of Townsvillian and Texan sensibilities has been seamless. Turns out, they aren\u2019t that different. But with contrasting comedic styles, this duo is surefire to deliver bang-on laughs.After learning how to drive in a cow pasture and using hay bales for target practice, stand-up comedy was next in Sabrina\u2019s sights. She\u2019s been honing her jokes performing around Melbourne and the United States, and now she\u2019s ready to bring her personal, warm and conversational style to this down \u2018n' dirty debut festival performance.With a scalpel-sharp wit, Alex is Australia\u2019s best (and only) veterinarian/stand-up comedian. That is, unless Dr Chris Brown and Julia Morris have a ventriloquism act we weren't aware of. Deadpan, dry and dark, she was a RAW Comedy VIC State Finalist in 2023, but prefers her steak well done.\n\r\nSpend the night with some country girls from different countries who believe in one thing\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that comedy is the toughest sport on dirt.\u00a0\u201cThis show impressed me much.\u201d\u00a0Shania Twain\"I can't even fathom what the second rodeo is gonna be like.\"\u00a0Gareth, Horse, Telepathically we are guessingThis show contains: Mild language.",

We\u2019ve hand-picked five brand-new stand-up shows by the best young comics in the business \u2013 and you get to say you saw them before they were big!Fully produced and performed by a diverse group of emerging young artists, every split bill is packed full of laugh-out-loud moments and supports Australia\u2019s most promising and ambitious faces in comedy. A ticket will get you into two of these shows each night, with all the details below.\r\n\u00a0Emma Armitage-Ho\u00a0\u2013 Ho Down\r\nA show about pasta, entering adulthood, sisters, the golden crumpet man and other random crap. Emma Armitage-Ho riffs on her adolescence, Chinese background and other musings with an endearing teenage gawkiness. Come along and laugh at the worst parts of her life, since the best parts aren\u2019t as funny.Erin Almeida\u00a0\u2013 Brownie Points\r\nErin Almeida is made of sugar and spice and everything (mostly) nice. However, with a childhood full of curries and kangaroos in rural Australia, there\u2019s a bit more spice than usual. Erin is a self-proclaimed \"white-washed brown girl\"\u00a0navigating the perks and quirks of being a seasoned enigma in a vanilla world. With this unique perspective, she challenges stereotypes with humour as bold and flavourful as a plateful of biryani.'Undaunted by an audience, Erin Almeida took time off from a hectic and often serious school schedule to win accolades as one of the country\u2019s best-up-and coming comedians.'\u00a0\u00a0The CourierPatti Fawcett \u2013 Okay, you romantic!\r\nPatti Fawcett\u2019s Okay, you romantic!\u00a0is a learning experience on getting wronged and getting revenge quietly with the least amount of confrontation possible. Let one of Australia\u2019s wittiest young comedians guide you through the truly unbelievable capers she gets herself into, with \u201ca sharp observational eye, a unique voice, a mastery of syntax, timing, cadence. Fawcett possesses all\u201d (The Age).Stella Hall \u2013\u00a0Smiling Without Teeth\r\nStella is the average girl next door \u2013\u00a0as long as you live in a suburb peppered with private schools and a median house price of $3.5m. She\u2019s a whip-smart comic whose intelligence unfortunately doesn\u2019t transfer into common sense. Stella never lets the truth get in the way of a good story, but she\u2019s not trying to make you laugh \u2013\u00a0that\u2019s way too much pressure.Mali Hawke \u2013 Life Hacks\nLife Hacks\u00a0is a sharp half-hour of musical comedy revealing what high school is really like. Mali Hawke was never top of his class, but he did get up to the most mischief. These are the stories he couldn\u2019t tell while he was in school, and probably shouldn\u2019t now.Wednesday 27\u00a0March\u00a0\u2013 Mali and Patti*\r\nThursday 28\u00a0March \u2013 Erin and Stella\r\nFriday 29\u00a0March \u2013 Emma and Mali*\r\nSaturday 30\u00a0March \u2013 Patti and Erin\r\nSunday 31\u00a0March \u2013 Emma and Stella*\r\nMonday 1\u00a0April (Comedy Industry Night) - Stella and Erin*Low visual",

Solidly funny, with a splash of sequins and an air of wonder, this strange yet charming adventure will be full of ups and downs while breaking open the truth and beauty of the atom.\u00a0After the success of A Flying Photon, which won the 2022 Adelaide Fringe Festival\u2019s Science at the Fringe Award, the award-winning formula is being bundled up into an exploration of the quantum world behind our everyday experiences, the states of matter and revealing that temperature is just jiggling atoms.

Armed with nothing but a spatula and a song in her heart, Meaty Sue sets off on a pork-tacular adventure filled with boisterous tunes, outrageous anecdotes, and enough meaty madness to make a vegetarian reassured with their life choices.\n\r\nSunny Youngsmith (they/them) is a non-binary multi-disciplinary artist based in Naarm (Melbourne) Australia. Their work focuses on exploring queer and neurodivergent perspectives as an actor, writer and producer.Big Farma is absurd, silly and queer with a Kath & Kim twist.

This show is a rollercoaster ride through Rao's unique perspective on everything from cultural identity to the existential dread of adulthood.Fever Dream touches on societal expectations\u00a0and the quest for self-identity in a world that constantly tries to pigeonhole us. Rao's humour is a blend of self-deprecation, sharp observations\u00a0and an uncanny ability to make light of the absurdities of life.The show isn't just a series of jokes but a narrative of growth, self-acceptance\u00a0and the constant struggle to find one's place in the world. Rao's ability to mix humour with deeper reflections on life makes\u00a0Fever Dream\u00a0a standout. It's a show that will make you laugh, think\u00a0and maybe even see the world a little differently.A judges\u2019 pick at the 2023 Melbourne Fringe,\u00a0Fever Dream\u00a0was described as a \"top-shelf observational stand-up \u2013\u00a0Rao Morusupalli is a comic to watch!

From a couple on the brink of a break-up to a quintessential fuccboi and a woman seeking validation through the gaze of others via serial swiping on dating apps, this production thoughtfully weaves together these disparate tales into a cohesive narrative that is both larger than life but also too too too real.Except to giggle. Try not to cry. Prepare to cringe.What sets TOXIC apart from traditional musical theatre is that we are not traditionally-trained musical theatre practitioners. Hannan Azlan is a decorated, globally-acclaimed performer and writer, having been featured on ABC, Comedy Central Asia, and MTV Asia, as well as a headlining comedian across Asia, Australia, the UK, EU\u00a0and USA. Shayne Hunter is an established pro comic and producer with a track-record of sold-out shows across Australia including pioneering groundbreaking alternative, interactive comedy production Crowd Control, as well as Comedy Walking Tour, a first of its kind in Brisbane, Melbourne\u00a0and Sydney. Oh. And. Uh, they used to date. What could possibly go wrong?At its core, TOXIC is a testament to the fact that comedy can be a powerful tool for introspection.\u00a0We invite you to laugh, let loose, groove to infectious tunes\u00a0and, most importantly, contemplate the intricate dance between love, desire\u00a0and the human psyche.This show contains: Drug references, Strong coarse language, References to self-harm and suicide, References to substance abuse, Strong sexual references.",

Which is why he's back at 27 and here to ruin your life.It\u2019s been a very big year for Jaxson. He lost his job, quit acting, started cross-dressing and went to the USA. Just in time for cross-dressing to get another lashing in the conservative media. Whoops.Now, after surviving his 27th year (and the US), he stares down the barrel of his Saturn Return,\u00a0which according to reddit, is like menopause for bored white people.\n\r\nWith one foot off the merry-go-round, Jaxson has questions about all this life stuff.\n\r\nWhat happens to us when we die? If there was a war, would Australia survive because we can grow our own shit? Does my cat hate me because he\u2019s homophobic? If someone is born every second, does someone cum every second? What are\u00a0the rules for being in a long term (open) relationship? Why don\u2019t I feel comfortable telling people at my education job that I do drag because I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll equate me with a pedophile?Is Saturn Return even real, and if I don\u2019t like it can I get a refund?\n\r\n\"Saturn is Lord of the right ear, the spleen, the bladder, the phlegm, and the bones.\"\u00a0Ptolemy\n\n'Tastefully outrageous.'\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 ArtsHub'Jaxson has an easy manner and is a storyteller.'\u00a0Weekend Notes'Comedy genius.\u00a0Hilarious.'\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\u00a0What Did She Think?This show contains: Strong coarse language, Political, religious or racial themes, Strong sexual references.",

That\u2019s the show \u2013 relatable.Maybe the pool is a metaphor for the idea of never being ready and constantly waiting. Waiting to get a job, waiting to move out, waiting to come out, waiting to admit that the only thing you want to drink year-round is iced lattes (same as coming out). In short, it\u2019s about growing up with one leg in the closet and the other in the pool. (Amusing for someone with no flexibility.)The show features story-based stand-up and sketches highlighting the brilliant but useless skills honed over years of hovering poolside waiting to dive in.A former Victorian RAW Comedy State Finalist, Chris has been seen at Comedy Republic, Pride Comedy and Harold Holt (the pool not the prime minister).This show contains: Mild language.",

Can I mainline the placebo effect?\u00a0 Come on a science comedy journey through the wild and weird and occasionally effective world of alternative medicine with Alanta as your test subject.In 2010 Alanta stood in a clinic in remote Uganda, watching a woman with malaria receive electric acupuncture and silver particles in water. When Alanta raised objections that this therapy didn\u2019t treat malaria she was threatened with defamation. While the threat was as bogus as the treatment, it sparked in Alanta a deep curiosity about what makes alternative medicines so alluring, which ones work, which ones don\u2019t and the mysterious power of the placebo effect.\u00a0While we grapple with the daily perils of a life confined within these fragile mortal vessels, it seems entirely sensible to search for any balm that might alleviate our aches, and make us healthier, happier\u00a0and better at parallel parking. But who do we turn to?As big pharma gets a bad rap more folk turn to big chakra. But how do we navigate the litany of therapies offering access to ancient wisdom,\u00a0invisible energy flows, the healing powers of exotic plants, animals and gurus? What is harmless, what is harmful\u00a0and what does the evidence say? Can science measure the healing powers of alternative medicine? Or is time spent googling clinical trials better spent pursuing influencers on instagram?\u00a0Which practitioners genuinely hold the promise for treating some of our most elusive ailments, and which ones are simply profiteering on the infirm and the desperate?\u00a0Come on a science comedy journey through the wild and weird and occasionally effective world of alternative medicine with Alanta as your test subject,\u00a0putting her money where her mouth is and trialling some of the more out there alternative treatments so you don\u2019t have to. This show is not covered by Medicare.\u00a0Alanta is a public health practitioner, comedian and\u00a0storyteller based in Melbourne. She runs Sci Fight Science Comedy Debate year round at Howler Melbourne,\u00a0where scientists and comedians come together to debate serious issues in a ridiculous manner. She\u2019s a regular guest on ABC Radio with David Astle, has appeared on ABC TV News and in Frankie Magazine. She also moderates for the Transitions Film Festival.\u00a0Alanta\u2019s debut solo show Parasites Lost sold out its entire run at Melbourne International Comedy Festival and was given an Inspiring Australia Science-Arts Grant to perform in Perth FRINGE WORLD. Alanta\u2019s second solo show Days of our Hives about bee keeping and bee losing attracted more bee keepers than any other show at Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Her third solo show,\u00a0On the Origin of Faeces had a lot of reviewers politely decline her invitation to attend.\u00a0Alanta\u2019s nerdy concoction of evidence-based comedy and personal confessions has been warmly received by audiences across Australia and internationally. Alanta is also a good source of protein and has been used in traditional medicine in the treatment of syphilis, guinea worm and can be used as a viable alternative to firewood.\n\r\n\"Horrified but laughing.\"\u00a0Gates Foundation employee\n\n'A delightful presence on stage and enchanting storyteller.'

(This one.)Doug tried to become the ideal, cookie-cutter version of himself \u2013\u00a0and it sucked. His WAAPA music theatre degree left him with more questions than answers about who he really was\u00a0and threw him into a mold that he just didn\u2019t seem to fit. But he\u2019s done trying to fit into someone else\u2019s definition of success. He\u2019s ready to lean into who he really is.Brave and Bold is a whirlwind of original songs, sketches, characters and jokes from a music theatre tragic (in recovery). With music that jumps from 2000s boy bands\u00a0to doo-wop\u00a0to samba, you\u2019ll be swept through Doug\u2019s fedora phase, some exciting news from Dua Lipa\u00a0and the audition process for Les Mis\u00e9rables.Sometimes, being yourself is the most brave and bold thing you can do.

Thanks to Mick Neven the looming collapse of civilisation is something we should all look forward to.Start Your Own Cult is\u00a0about more than just starting a cult. It\u2019s about life, love, alien invasion, conspiracy theory and 90\u2019s grunge band Nirvana. If you\u2019ve ever considered swapping the rat race for the laid-back idyll of a sex cult, this is your show. If you think there are too many ice cream flavours, this is your show. If you own a Star Wars storm trooper outfit, this is probably not your show. If you\u2019ve ever watched the TV show Alone and thought \"I could do that\", this is your show. If you\u2019ve ever watched Pornhub alone and thought \"I could do that\", this could also be your show. If you like monster trucks, it\u2019s probably not for you.Anyway \u2013 here are some review quotes from previous work by Mick Neven that say things about him as a performer.'Neven\u2019s stand up is so slick, he's seriously entertaining.' \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00a0The Age\u00a0'He delivers a performance with punch, humour and a heart.' \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00a0Herald Sun\u00a0'A roller-coaster Wizard of a ride from Oz.' \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00a0The International TimesAnd now, here is a bit of Mick\u2019s performance bio - Mick Neven has been performing stand-up comedy around Australia and around the world for 18 of your \u201cEarth years\u201d. He\u2019s toured Canada and the US, performed at the Edinburgh Fringe five times and has completed three tours of duty to the Middle East to perform for Australia\u2019s Defence Force members serving overseas. Mick is a two-time winner of the Perth FRINGE WORLD Weekly Award for Best Comedy Show. You may have seen him on television over the years, including on the Quiz show Temptation\u00a0when he won $3500 cash and a $3000 washing machine, and on Millionaire Hot Seat\u00a0where he nearly won $250,000 but missed out because he\u2019d never heard of King Canute.

Find out in this exciting talent show as we put Australia's best young comedians against each other for a night of laughs, silliness, and creativity!\n\r\nLouis Prandolini and Ethan Gallagher are bringing The Gen Z Comedy Talent-O-Rama back to MICF in 2024! The Gen Z Comedy Talent-O-Rama consists of a series of generation Z comedians each presenting their own 5-minute stand-up comedy set. This year\u2019s lineup is sure to bring the laughs - they may all be young, but they are all extremely experienced with comedy, most of them having been involved with MICF\u2019s Class Clowns in previous years. The lineup includes: Louis Prandolini, Ethan Gallagher, Mali Hawke, Patti Fawcett, Luke DeBuhr and Hannah DeBuhr (also known as the Silly Siblings), and Rerose Roro.\n\nLouis Prandolini, a young but experienced comedian, has presented and performed in many comedy shows over the years, such as Dreaming of Zop, Extra Credit, You Might be Incredible, and The 2022 Gen Z Comedy Talent-O-Rama! He also participated in MICF\u2019s Up Next Comedy in 2022, and was a finalist in MICF Class Clowns 2021.\n\nEthan Gallagher was a finalist in MICF\u2019s Class Clowns in 2019 and 2021, and was a joint winner of the event in 2021. He has presented various comedy shows, such as Extra Credit in 2021, Dreaming of Zop in 2023, and Pilot in 2024.\n\nMali Hawke has performed in many venues, from Deakin Edge in Federation Square to Bendigo, Victoria. He hosted Up Next Comedy in December 2023, and has over 30 million views online.\n\nPatti Fawcett was the winner of MICF Class Clowns in 2019. She regularly works with Bendigo Comedy Festival, and also writes music in her spare time.\n\nLuke and Hannah DeBuhr, also known as the Silly Siblings, have performed extensively with festivals, such as Melbourne Fringe 2022, The Ballarat Begonia Festival 2023, and of course MICF 2023. They were also MICF Class Clowns national finalists in 2019.\n\nRerose Roro is a 2019 MICF Class Clowns national finalist, but she is also well known for her poetry, having participated regularly in the Australian Poetry Slam. She won her regional heat in 2019 and 2021 and was a national finalist as well in 2021.\n\r\nEach performer will be bringing their own set, so it\u2019s almost like you get 6 shows for the price of one!",

Some people may think it\u2019s a blessing, but she\u2019s here to tell you that being cute comes at a cost. Like all Australian pioneers, Elouise leads you on a journey through the unchartered territory of hotness in comedy \u2013 from being an AFL Grand Final dancer to Aaron Chen\u2019s ex-wife to pissing off Ricky Nixon.Elouise bridges the thigh gap between serving good jokes and giving good face. Australia\u2019s First\u00a0Attractive Comedian is a raucous romp through the life of a quadruple threat, tackling outdated feminism and disgusting men through stand-up, extensive dance training, a trained singing voice and professional acting (you\u2019re welcome). You think it\u2019s hard being funny? Try being smart and good looking on top of that.\u00a0Join Elouise for her debut solo hour as she subverts the meaning of feminism, attractiveness and owning yourself in a world that tells you to hate yourself to be funny.\u00a0This show contains: Audience participation.",

Unlucky in love? Jealous of your successful best friend? Broke? Fugly? Always disappointing your dad? Is it time you weren't so lazy?Escape the rat race of the modern world with the warm helping hands of two celestial beings who hold all the secrets to unlock your new amazing life.Ghiathora is one of Australia\u2019s most prolific healers hailing from the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. A practicing clairvoyant, phys-kick and spiritual healer with over 40 years' experience (in this lifetime).Marharlija Taramasalattaa (West Hollywood, Los Angeles) is an up-and-cuming cunnilingus yoga master and root chukra reconstructor. Marharlija is the youngest ever to receive a black belt in spiritual awakening and third-eye fitness at just 17 years old.\u00a0On a 60-day waterfall cleanse ten minutes outside of Kuta, Ghiathora locked eyes with Marharlija. Marharlija was undergoing her 42nd rear algae absorption challenge, where she had to straddle-split on a river rock consuming only the rainforest algae absorbed through her undercarriage, for the whole 60 days.\u00a0This is where their joint journey into enlightenment (through teaching the less conscious) began.Together they have carefully deconstructed a 55-minute mind, body and wind immersive session, showcasing exercises such as guided mindless meditation, amaurotic visualisations, root chukra expurgating and spirit guide summoning. Honouring celestial wisdoms passed down from Sensei to students over thousands of years.\u00a0Ghiathora is taking time out from promoting her upcoming bestselling selling book 5 signs you may no longer be Alive\u00a0to gift you an exclusive healing experience. Witness Ghiathora in all her glory as she showcases ancient healing techniques with assistance from Marhalija Taramasalattaa (who will be recording the audiobook available now on Audible.)The class includes yoga mats, candles, incense and rack-iee (either up the nose or blown right up your back chamber) to help you finally reach a higher state of vibrational being.Testimonials\"\u201cAfter my third divorce in just under 14 years, I decided it was time to face my adrenal blockages and scoliosis if I wanted to finally find my one and only twin flame. I can\u2019t thank Ghiathora and Mahalijha enough for their patience and guidance as I stepped into my truth. I may have lost a couple of teeth, but it was all worth it when Terry, my twin flame who just happened to be a Tamworth truck driver, drove straight through my heart. Terry, if you\u2019re reading this please come back!\u201d Kelly Mae, Cumnock NSW.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI was really skeptical of all this shit until my miso ran off with my best mate back in 2021. After doing Ghiathora and Mahalijha\u2019s spiritual session and summoning my spirit guide, I realised that I was actually a dog. No wonder she left.\u201d\u00a0Jake, Cronulla NSW.\u201cAfter losing my beloved guinea pigs sparkles and bulles to hyperthermia in July 2019. I needed to find a way to contact them to apologise.

She juggles bills and her son's education while running her sushi bar. The show is very crazy, hilarious and surreal with quirky handmade puppets including the main puppet Sushi Master and her teenage son, Takeru. Then there\u2019s a cat, Ginger who has problems with her very jealous partner, an excessive eater called One Eye, the facelift & Botox addict, Scarlet and Allergy Angel who has allergic to everything including people who talk about their allergies and herself!Imagine Mighty Boosh meets Midnight Diner via the Muppets\u00a0Armed with a sharp wit, a keen sense of kookiness, and quirky collection of hand-made puppets, Showko invites everyone to her surreal sitcom.Audiences appreciate her ability to connect with them during live performances, a skill she attributes to her training as a Rakugo performer in both Japan and London. Showko is the only fully trained Rakugo performer living outside Japan. Rakugo is like martial arts, requires the apprentice to train under a master. The difference being that in martial arts you learn how to kick arse; in Rakugo you learn how to make someone laugh their arse off!Created and performed by Showko - ABC, Amazon Prime VideoDirected by Jason Marion \u2013 Melbourne International Comedy Festival award-winning director, Spicks and Specks Accompanist, Steve Colebrook \u2013 Legendary Melbourne musician (Cattletruck, Hey, Hey, It\u2019s Saturday, Countdown )'Absolutely hilarious and frigging fantastic!' \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Glam Adelaide'Exceptional.' \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Herald Sun'Showko is a top rate ventriloquist.

All through high school, Gerry and Nick shared a passion for music \u2013 two competitive siblings with one teenage dream of playing stadiums all around the world! That 1991 trophy was the validation of their hopes! The beginning of two glittering careers...Then he got a \u201cnormal job\u201d, and she went into musical comedy \u2013 could things get any worse? Hell yeah!After putting on extra performances and playing to sold out crowds with a blistering come-back show BROAD\u00a0in 2022, Geraldine Quinn (Spicks and Specks, The Weekly, Upper Middle Bogan\u00a0and that superannuation ad on the escalator) returns to Malthouse Theatre with her most personal show to date.Growing up in a ridiculously large family in Wagga Wagga, then moving to the outskirts of Melbourne, siblings Gerry and Nick were particularly close. He picked out her first guitar, he played on her first starry-eyed four-track demo and he tried (in vain) to get her to learn basic music theory. She still sucks at it \u2013 ask her band! Yet in spite of her dodgy guitar tabs, Geraldine stumbled into some semblance of a performance career, while Nick did the 9-to-5 family thing. So what happens when the big plans you shared as kids get stretched in two different directions?The Passion of Saint Nicholas\u00a0is a rock cabaret about following your heart, the friction of divergent paths\u00a0and keeping the band together when you lose your biggest cheerleader.'The sort of electric thunderclap that inspires audience members to hoot out loud and bump the air with their fists in empowered solidarity, it lays down the gauntlet for the moment to beat.'\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Time Out\u00a0'Her uncanny knack for handling everything from torch songs to musical comedy is both impressive and jaw-dropping.' \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Theatre People'After seeing BROAD I have decided that Geraldine Quinn is my queen of cabaret.

She honed her skills in the best of Melbourne\u2019s worst open mic rooms and is now in high demand as an MC and feature act in rooms all over Australia and occasionally beyond.Lauded by audiences and comics alike, Nicky was most recently nominated for Best Spoken Word and Storytelling at Sydney Fringe 2023.

Hello tax time, foreign toilets and parenthood! Riding the wave of her 2023 success, Bron\u2019s 2024 show Obviously\u00a0is set to be huge.Bron\u00a0is a natural storyteller, and Obviously\u00a0is packed to the brim with\u00a0hilarious anecdotes of times when she has found herself stumbling through moments of complete confusion with her fingers crossed and a smile on her face.From joining a mother\u2019s group and sitting next to the patchouli mum, to being held hostage in Africa by a man with a plastic police badge, Bron is no stranger to pretending everything is under control. Because obviously it is. Never shying away from an act-out, Bron\u2019s comedic physicality and formidable stage presence bring\u00a0every story to life.Obviously\u00a0will be an hour of laughter you don\u2019t want to miss.Obviously.'Hilarity and humanity - a joy to behold.'

Catch him as he perfectly captures the essence and rhythm of Singaporean life, translated into uproarious tales and observations that resonate across continents.As Fuzz navigates the crossroads of his Singaporean/Malaysian roots and his experiences in the global comedy scene, you're in for a treat that's as insightful as it is hilarious. It's a blend of Singapore's pulsing energy with international comedic nuances, all delivered with Fuzz's unmatched charisma.Join Fuzz for an evening that promises a harmonious blend of humor and heart. Experience the magic when the distinctive beat of the Lion City meets the rest\u00a0of the world. This 2024 rendezvous is set to be a laughter-packed sensation you won't want to miss!A comedic star has risen from the urban totalitarian seriousness of Singapore with the trail blazing tracks of Fakkah Fuzz. In the past six years the bald and bearded man of comedy has been delivering heavyweight punch lines all across the globe.A feature at 2019\u2019s Melbourne\u2019s International Comedy Festival saw him cement a decade of gut cramping style \u2013 and swag \u2013 that are coupled with the weight of experience under his belt. Only in the previous year of 2018, he phenomenally sold out Esplande\u2019s (Singapore) 2000 seater Theatre with the\u00a0Unmarried\u00a0show. Fuzz\u2019s ability to sell out a show in Singapore as a born and bred stand-up comedian from the tropical metropolis was expected, when in 2017 he was the only Singaporean comedian to have his own\u00a0Netflix special\u00a0Almost Banned, garnering buzz from critiques, critics and\u00a0kopitiam\u00a0critters alike.Chiming in for a chuckle in Laugh Factory\u2019s Funniest Person in the World competition in Hollywood, Los Angeles (2016) \u2013 earning him a top five result \u2013 as well as the Laugh Festival in Hong Kong (2019), prompted Beat Magazine, Australia to recognise his \"risque commentary and goofy mannerism\"\u00a0as a brilliant way to close off Comedy Zone Asia at\u00a0Melbourne International Comedy Festival by \"giving a snapshot of an experience that\u2019s uniquely Singaporean\".Making big strides as a stand up comedian come with great laughs for Fuzz, as he headed\u00a0into 2020 with 'The More Better Podcast' series \u2013 stomping his way from one bigger spot lit stage to the next.",

In RESTLESS, Ashley reaches for comfort and connection to get out of her head, and into your heart.Through her offbeat performance style, clever misdirection and cheeky crowd work, Apap demonstrates the tension that propels her very being. RESTLESS is one Silly Duffer\u2019s absurdist attempt at laughing in the face of her endless overwhelm. With the help of cautious optimism, an enduring curiosity for truth and a fondness for friendship, Ashley is not taking standing up, lying down.Ashley Apap is a Melbourne/Naarm-based writer/comedian whose work focuses on melding accessibility, silliness and sincerity. Her debut Melbourne International Comedy Festival hour Ouch! was nominated for the 2022 Golden Gibbo Award and played to sold out crowds and she's since been performing her high-energy stand-up, sketch, improv and musical comedy around Australia. Ashley recently made her professional acting debut in the new Malthouse Theatre work 'Telethon Kid' as well as creating/writing/producing her new video podcast 'Scamp' (produced with Stupid Old Studios for Powerd Media). Available on Powerd Media's streaming platform that showcases content made by disabled artists, it encapsulates Ashley's colourful, quick, unique sense of humour in a world made by and for her relentless mind. Classified by The Age as having \u201cgreat comic potential\u201d and \u201ca voice not often heard\u201d, Ashley is a breath of fresh air in the Melbourne comedy scene.'Great comic potential... a voice not often heard.'\u00a0The Age\n\n'Apap is unapologetically and unashamedly brilliant.'\u00a0Weekend Notes\n\n'Apap\u2019s stand-up skills are exceptional... a natural performer and a gifted comic.'\u00a0Theatre Travels\n\n'Ashley delivered an offbeat set but with such a charismatic and entrancing manner that she had the audience immediately engaged.'\u00a0Hugging Comedians\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00a0Theatre Thoughts\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00a0Theatre People\u00a0***Please note Tuesday 2 April at Stupid Old Studios\u00a0is a Live Stream event.

Nothing is off limits as they reflect on what it is to be human in the 21st century through relatable examinations of life paired with \u201crazor sharp wit and, at times, jaw dropping observations\u201d (Her Canberra).Over the past few years, Trish and Jacqui have won a legion of new comedy fans by giving an hilarious voice to older women everywhere, who have technically always had a voice, despite no one being bothered to listen. Following two sell out seasons at the Canberra Comedy Festival with their show The Women\u2019s Room, both Trish and Jacqui made it through to the RAW Comedy Grand Final\u00a0in Melbourne. Jacqui took home the prize for National Runner Up.In their debut season in the Sydney Fringe Festival at the Factory Theatre, The Women\u2019s Room was nominated for Best in Comedy 2023.Jacqui Richards is an ex-therapist and a tired mother of five who doesn't know how she got here.She has been described as deliciously dark, turning tales of woe to wonderfully funny observations. Her gut-busting comedy always takes her audiences by surprise. Jacqui\u2019s husband passed away during COVID which had the odd consequence of turning her into a dark party planner. Nothing like a 20 person limit on a funeral guest list to help you uncover a new talent. Unfortunately, Jacqui later experienced things from the other side, when she was culled from her \u2018grief group\u2019s\u2019 guest list.'Where there\u2019s a clich\u00e9, there\u2019s a gag to undermine it, and Richards finds plenty.'\u00a0Chortle\u00a0(UK)Trish Hurley is a country girl, mother, ex-nurse and self-confessed hypochondriac who has a habit of diagnosing her friends with obscure illnesses.\u00a0Trish spends a lot of time and energy worrying about diseases she doesn't have and ignoring the ones she does. Although Trish says she peaked in primary school, she is the life of every party, even ones she hasn\u2019t been invited to. She is a gifted storyteller with the most infectious laugh that will have you questioning whether any of what she is saying could possibly be true (it is, unfortunately).Both Trish and Jacqui think they are the better comedian. These accidental best friends show the power of humour and female friendships at any stage of life. By the end of the show you will be begging them to be your best friend too (they will probably say yes).This show is for women everywhere and the people who love them.This show contains: Death and grief, Occasional coarse language.",

Recently featured on The Amazing Race Australia and newly added to the triple j weekend presenting crew, Frankie is a rising talent that you definitely won't want to overlook!Henry Yan (VIC)\r\nIn 2023, Henry\u00a0emerged victorious at Melbourne In ternational Comedy Festival\u2019s RAW Comedy National Grand Final and showcased his talents at the Edinburgh Fringe's So You Think You Are Funny? competition.

Rapha wowed audiences and judges alike across the 2023 RAW Comedy competition and is sure to be one of the most talked about artists at this year\u2019s Festival.William Wang (VIC)\r\nHailing from China, William\u00a0immigrated to Australia seven years ago, where he discovered his comedic calling.

In his first ever solo stand-up show the social misfit reveals all in this dark look into his life,\u00a0past and present.A physiatrist once diagnosed JNewtz by saying \"With his eclectic clothing style and traces of makeup, I'd suggest he has identity issues!\"We've all had\u00a0a mid-life crisis, imposter syndrome, anxiety, questioning your purpose, low self-esteem, feeling like a misfit\u00a0\u2013\u00a0call it what you will, basically it's an Identity Crisis.JNewtz never felt like he fit in\u00a0\u2013\u00a0at school, sports clubs, his body or even his voice. The only thing that gave him a feeling of belonging was punk-rock music,\u00a0a genre that reached out to all the outcasts and touched a chord deep inside them. It was this music that gave JNewtz a feeling of rebelling, a feeling of being different, a\u00a0love of alternative styles of clothing, makeup and hair colouring \u2013\u00a0all the things that are non-conforming to what normal people call \u2018society\u2019.Becoming JNewtz was to depart from who he was and create a new style, a new attitude and a new outlook on life. Learing to accept who you are, what you are and who you want to be\u00a0\u2013\u00a0all while enduring an on-going Identity Crisis along the way.\u201cLife is all about laughing; laughing at ourselves. Sometimes it\u2019s light-heated and other times it\u2019s dark.

There's even a guy who works on an oil rig!The Insecuribles are\u00a0Gemma Davidson, Josh Vinen, Marc Isaac and Raff Dall.Gemma Davidson is a fresh face on the scene with a lot to say about her super queer family. When not on stage you can find her obsessing over her new puppy and ignoring her quarter life crisis.Gracing us during his time off the oil rig is Joshua Vinen. Coming from a background in improv Josh is no stranger to a stage or being a part of a semi cult. That's in reference to improv groups and not his Mormon parents. Josh is undoubtedly a free spirit, which he got from his aunt, the dominatrix.Marc Isaac brings queer flamboyant charm to the group, but despite their professional demeanour in their day job as a medico, best not to ask this outrageous Celt what\u2019s hiding underneath the kilt!Moonlighting as a DJ is Raff Dall. He has recently starred in a short film 'The Lost Pints.' He also had a spot on Neighbours as an extra watching someone choke on their lunch!

Let's find out in this show.Sean Xi Diao was born in China and moved to Australia in 2013. He has been performing stand-up comedy for many years and currently resides in Melbourne. His unique dry humor and silly comedy style have endeared him to people all over the world.

In this comedy show, Sean explores various humorous topics, including his unfortunate Chinese name, light teasing of the Australian language, applying for a Chinese visa, phone apps\u00a0and, of course, his biggest fear in Australia.Sean has appeared on Australian TV channels such as ABC and\u00a0SBS, and local radio programs like Triple R.
